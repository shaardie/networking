# Networking

Networking can be challenging - even if you learned it at school or university.

When I discovered the tool [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/), which makes it easy to create complex networking environments inside containers, I wanted to start building some examples and explain how they work.

I decided to use simple [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) containers as a base, rather than any fancy network operating system, so you can focus on learning the basics of Linux network configuration.

## Who is this for?

This repository is aimed at people who already have some experience with Linux and containers, and who might have learned the basics of networking at some point. 

The goal here is not to teach Linux or container fundamentals, but to provide **practical examples** that help you understand common networking structures in a hands-on way.

## How to read this?

The examples in this repository are organized in a way that reflects how networking concepts often build on each other. Some chapters depend on knowledge from others, but you **don’t need to follow them strictly in order**.  

Think of it more like a **tree structure**: you can jump into a topic that interests you, and then explore related chapters as needed. Each example is designed to be practical, so you can experiment hands-on and see the concepts in action.
